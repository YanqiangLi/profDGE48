*********************************************************************
Profiling Differential Gene Expression with a 48 replicate experiment
*********************************************************************

Welcome to the documentation for the collection of scripts developed by 
members of `The Barton Group <http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/>`_ at `The 
University of Dundee <http://www.dundee.ac.uk/>`_ to process and analyse the 
data from a 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment conducted specifically to test the
underlying assumptions and performance of popular RNA-seq Differential Gene 
Expression (DGE) tools. The results of the original analysis are presented in
the following publications:

	.. _paper1:

	1. `Statistical models for RNA-seq data derived from a two-condition 48-replicate experiment, Bioinformatics (2015) doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv425 <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/22/bioinformatics.btv425.abstract>`_
	
	.. _paper2:

	2. Evaluation of tools for differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq on a 48 biological replicate experiment, RNA (2015) doi: 10.1261/rna.053959.115

The aim of the study was to use real, rather than simulated, data to characterize the 
underlying character of RNA-seq data and to determine which, if any, tools were
most appropriate for measuring differential gene expression (DGE) from 
RNA-seq data. A full description of the experiment is given in 
`Schurch et. al. (2015) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02017>`_.The scripts in this 
collection are written in a wide variety of languages (due
to the collaborative nature of the project) including 
`perl <https://www.perl.org/>`_,
`python <https://docs.python.org/2/>`_ and 
`R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_. For further assistance with these scripts or the documentation please contact one of
